This is a collection of source code that was written for the class Embedded Control at Rensselaer Polytechnic Instiute.

Most of this code was written by me. All code that labeled as being an activity was entirely written by me as activity assignments were individual.
Assignments labeled as Labs were co-written by my parter and I.

The repository does not represent the entire output of the class. Many assignments did not require coding, or there is code which I cannot find as I switch computers at the end of the semester.
