This is a collection of source code that was written for the class Embedded Control (ENGR 2350) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Most of this code was written by me. All code that labeled as being an activity was entirely written by me as activity assignments were individual.
Assignments labeled as Labs were co-written by my parter and I. You can tell that AI was only used for debugging purposes due to the plethora of typos in the comments.

The repository does not represent the entire output of the class. Many assignments did not require coding, or there is code which I cannot find as I switch computers at the end of the semester.

If you are reading this, you are most likely an employer looking to hire me. Thank you for taking the time to look at my work, and I hope you were impressed with what you saw and 
consider me for future employment. :)
